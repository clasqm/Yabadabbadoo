summary			"Alternative IDE for yab"
Description			"Yabadabbadoo is an alternative IDE for the yab programming language. It structures your subroutines into separate files, which are combined at run/compile time. This makes it easier to write longer programs - for short programs, you might as well use the official yab IDE. In a way, I tried to recreate the UI I recall from my days with QuickBasic.

Please REMOVE any existing Yabadabbadoo package older than 0.3.2 before installing this one. It does not remove old installations cleanly. Entirely my fault (the package architecture descriptor was changed from 'x86_gcc2' to 'any'), shouldn't happen in the future.

Beta 3 brings in the following features:

* Use of Workspace 4 is now optional.
* Works better with screens smaller than 1024x768. The YabAssistant is the last problematic area and even that should work OK if you have at least 600 vertical pixels to play with.
* Create a desktop shortcut to your project that lets you open it with one double-click. Shortcuts (actually little bash scripts) can be moved and renamed, as long as you don't move or rename the project itself.
* Open your project in the official yab-IDE, so that you can use the BuildFactory.
* No longer contains its own version of yab, now that we can specify the official version as a dependency. yab4ybd is retained as a symlink to yab for reasons of backwards compatibility. This may not last forever, so update the first line in any existing Yabadabbadoo programs!

Beta3 is slightly less idiosyncratic than previous versions. But only slightly. It will always be a deeply personal project.
